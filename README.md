# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 


Milestone 1
The preliminary game logic for the overall project was established here. The main objective was to introduce control flows such as if else to help check user's input. The file milestone_2.py was created which contained the code for this milestone and  it contained random list called word_list wherein random choice of words can be selected at intervals.

Milestone 2
Does what you have built in this milestone connect to the previous one? If so explain how. What technologies are used? Why have you used them? Have you run any commands in the terminal? If so insert them using backticks (To get syntax highlighting for code snippets add the language after the first backticks).

Example below:

/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181
The above command is used to check whether the topic has been created successfully, once confirmed the API script is edited to send data to the created kafka topic. The docker container has an attached volume which allows editing of files to persist on the container. The result of this is below:
"""Insert your code here"""
Insert screenshot of what you have built working.

Milestone n
Continue this process for every milestone, making sure to display clear understanding of each task and the concepts behind them as well as understanding of the technologies used.

Also don't forget to include code snippets and screenshots of the system you are building, it gives proof as well as it being an easy way to evidence your experience!

Conclusions
Maybe write a conclusion to the project, what you understood about it and also how you would improve it or take it further.

Read through your documentation, do you understand everything you've written? Is everything clear and cohesive??
